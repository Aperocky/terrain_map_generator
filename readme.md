# Map Generator

This is a map generator for pretty discrete altitude map.

usage:

`python map_gen_utils.py [name(str)], [size(int)], [climate(float)]`

This will create a folder in maps/ which will contain numpy file of altitude map, water flow map, and a pretty map image. Each new generation will be completely random - more tweakables are within code.

Dependencies: `Scipy, Matplolib, Numpy`

Coming up:

Lake simulation
